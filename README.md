### Dependencies

This app relies on devise, mailgun-ruby, angular-ui-bootstrap-rails, dotenv-rails, puma and postgres. All of these can be pulled in from the gemfile by running bundle.

### How to access staging and production and deploy to those environments:

Set up git remote: center.heroku.com/articles/git###creating-a-heroku-remote

Once you're added as a collobarator on Heroku for product and staging, you can create remotes with the commands below:

``` 
git remote add staging git.heroku.com/staging-svp-chicago.git
git remote add production git.heroku.com/production-svp-chicago.git 
```

To push to one of these, use this command:

```
git push <environment> <branch>
```

### Setting up a local database populated with sample data:

Locally, run:

```
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
rake db:seed <- To pull in some seed data
```

For heroku environments, run commands like so:

```
heroku run <command> â€“remote <environment>
```
