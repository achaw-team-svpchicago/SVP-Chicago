<h3 class="form-title well">6. Organizational Capacity Challenges</h3>
<h4>In this section, we want to get an idea of how you organization allocates its staff time, as well as to understand what your key organizational challenges are in different areas.</h4>
<p>An FTE is the hours worked by one employee on a full-time basis. The concept is used to convert the hours worked by several part-time employees into the hours worked by full-time employees. On an annual basis, an FTE is considered to be 2,080 hours, which is calculated as: 8 hours per day x 5 work days per week.</p>
<p>For each section, please indicate how much time your organization allocates to that focus area in FTEs. Please also indicate up to 3 challenges your organization has in the focus area. Do not feel obligated to provide challenges in each area. We are interested in your most significant issues. We are looking for quality, not quantity.</p><hr>
